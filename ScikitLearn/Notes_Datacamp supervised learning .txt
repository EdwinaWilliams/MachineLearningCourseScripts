train_test_split 
splits the data into 4 variables 
	X_train = training features
	y_train = training lables 
	X_test = test features
	y_test = test lables (will be used to see what the accuracy is 
							number of correct predctions / total dataset)
							
best practice 75 train 25 test
	
Use stratify = y (labels) --> so that the split reflect the lables of your data so that your labels is evenly distributed as they are in your data

use knn.score(X_test, y_test) to test the predictions accuracy of your model)
